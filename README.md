CommandLineRunner
=================

It gives command line commands a UI dynamically. It exists to make it easier for people to run and save command line code. So for example, a non developer wants to show desktop in Mac. There is a command line code that does this. The developer sends the command line script to their friend and they enter it into this tool. They can then run it with a UI.
